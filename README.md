# Bank-Personal-Loan-Modelling (Self Project)

## Bank Personal Loan Modelling and Prediction | Machine Learning Classification Self Project	 - Nov’22 - Dec’22

**Objective**
- Devise a **classifying model** using ML algorithms to predict the likelihood of a customer buying personal loan <br/>

**Approach**
- Performed **exploratory data analysis** to observe the relationship between different attributes of the dataset <br/>
- Transformed and preprocessed data by converting categorical features to binary values using one-hot encoding technique <br/>
- Implemented various classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, KNN and Random Forest <br/>

**Conclusion** 
- Enumerated precision results and achieved highest F1-score of 0.90 and accuracy of 0.98 with Random Forest classifier <br/>
